# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Welcome to the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) repository! This repository contains an implementation of the KNN algorithm in Python.

## Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.

## Implemented Features
- KNN algorithm implementation
- Comparison with sklearn's KNeighborsClassifier
- Evaluation using test data
