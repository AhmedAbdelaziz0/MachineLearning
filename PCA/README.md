# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Documentation

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used algorithm for dimensionality reduction. It identifies the directions (principal components) along which the variance of the data is maximized, allowing for data projection onto these components.

## Overview

### What is PCA?
PCA is a statistical technique used to simplify a dataset by reducing its dimensionality while retaining most of the variation present in the data.

### Why Do We Need PCA?
PCA helps in:
- Reducing computational complexity.
- Removing noise and redundancy.
- Improving visualization of high-dimensional data.
- Enhancing the performance of machine learning algorithms by eliminating correlated features.

### Implementation
1. **Normalize the Data**: Ensure the data has zero mean.
2. **Compute the Covariance Matrix**: Determine the covariance matrix of the normalized data.
3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
4. **Select Components**: Sort the eigenvalues and choose the top n components, or determine the explained variance to select components that capture the desired percentage of data variance.
5. **Form New Data**: Project the data onto the selected eigenvectors.

### Testing
To verify your PCA implementation:
1. Compare the results with the PCA implementation from the Scikit-learn library.
2. Note that eigenvectors can have different signs but still represent the same principal components.
3. Ensure the principal components and explained variance ratios are equivalent.

### Issues
- Eigenvectors may have different signs when comparing results from different libraries (e.g., NumPy vs. Scikit-learn). Both positive and negative signs are valid.
- Selecting the number of components requires careful consideration to balance dimensionality reduction and information retention.

### Conclusion
PCA is a powerful tool for reducing data dimensionality and improving the performance of machine learning models. Proper normalization, selection of components, and verification are crucial for effective PCA application.
